## History of Project:
There is a game company and we are trying to create new customer descriptions(persona) with using these customers specifications. According to these new descriptions, we should create customer segments. We need to predict how much money customers will make to the company by using segments.

For example, we want to learn how much money an American male user who is using IOS and 21-year-old can make on average.

## History of Dataset:
Persona.csv dataset shows the prices of products which was sold by an international game company. Also, there are some demographic information of users who purchased these products.

The data set consists of records created in each sales transaction. So the table is not deduplicated. In other words, a user with certain demographic characteristics may have multiple purchased.

## Variables:
PRICE: Customer's spending amount <br/>
SOURCE: The type of device the customer is using <br/>
SEX: Customer's gender <br/>
AGE: Customer's age <br/>
COUNTRY: Country where the customer lives
